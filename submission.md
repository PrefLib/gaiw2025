*Paper Length:* Papers can be at most 8 pages long in AAMAS format, or 12 pages long in LNCS format. Additional pages for may be used for references. Supplemental material can be appended at the end of the paper. However, reviewers are instructed to make their evaluations based on the main submission, and are not obligated to consult the supplemental material.

*Multiple Submission:* To widen participation and encourage discussion, there will be no formal publication of workshop proceedings. We will, however, post the accepted papers online to the benefit of the participants to the workshop. Therefore, submission of preliminary work and papers to be submitted or in preparation for submission to other major venues in the field are encouraged.

<!--
*Anonymity:* We leave the option up to submitters (except for in the case of resubmitted work below) as to whether or not to submit single- or double- anonymous. If you wish to submit single anonymous only (i.e., authors names are revealed), please leave your name(s) on the submission. However, the submission system will be set to not reveal authors information to reviewers within the system.
-->

*Past Submissions:* In order to strike a balance between new work and work that may have been presented but not widely seen we ask that if authors want to submit published work they do so non-anonymously and clearly indicate when and where the work was published. We will only accept work which has been published in the last calendar year (e.g., IJCAI 2024, NeurIPS 2024, AAAI 2025, and any conference held strictly after Feb. 2024).

*Best Presentation Award:* The organizing committee of GAIW will be giving two awards (first-place and runner up) for best paper presentations. The award criteria include the clarity of presentation, the level of engagement, the content, and discussion handline.

*Inquiries:* If you have any questions, direct them to alan.tsang@carleton.ca
